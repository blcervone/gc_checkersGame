# Grand Circus Basic Checkers Game Generator

The code included generates a basic checkerboard NumPy array based on user inputted board dimensions, then performs various array manipulation steps to generate new versions of the game board.

This assignement focused on importing packages, specifically NumPy, and how to utilize the most common methods included in NumPy.

Each file includes pseudocode at the top that walks through the steps taken to build the program to the required specifications. The main steps involved importing various parts of NumPy correctly, such as random, resize, and swapaxes, using those methods to define functions that returned a specific manipulation of the created game board, and finally, calling those functions from a seperate Python file (which requires another correct import).

The most challenging part of this assignment was getting familiar with the various methods included in NumPy, and what they can and cannot do. Finding the right method for the game board manipulation required took some testing to get the required output.
